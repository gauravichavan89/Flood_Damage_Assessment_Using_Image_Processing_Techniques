# Flood_Damage_Assessment_Using_Image_Processing_Techniques
In order to estimate every residential accommodation, we segregated the model functionality such that it caters to two primary requirements. The first requirement is to compute the area of the property and the second requirement is to produce the top and street view of the property which would help one in demonstrating the propertyâ€™s architectural design(address, presence and type of garage, number of storeys, living area space). This was achieved using GIS, Satellite &amp; Street View Images, Google Maps and Places API, JSP, JSON &amp; jQuery. This property assessment was undertaken as a precautionary measure for flood damage control by the 'Government of Alberta'.
